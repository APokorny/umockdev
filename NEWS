0.2.2 (UNRELEASED)
------------------
- umockdev-run: Fix segfault if no program is specified. (issue #6)
- preload: Print proper error message instead of assertion when trying to load
  an empty or invalid ioctl record. (issue #8)
- umockdev-run: Fix --help output to not mention the child program twice.
- Fix DEVNAME property with older libudev versions.
- Handle "L:" (link priority) lines from udevadm for newer udev versions.
- Fix segfault with gcc 4.8 (due to changed behaviour of sizeof).
- Drop our posix_extra backport of execvp(), this was added to Vala 0.16.1.
  Bump vala dependency accordingly.

0.2.1 (2013-02-21)
------------------
- umockdev-wrapper: Use exec to avoid keeping the shell process around and make
  killing the subprogram from outside work properly.
- Fix building with automake 1.12, thanks Peter Hutterer.
- Support opening several netlink sockets (i. e. udev monitors) at the same
  time.
- Fix building with older kernels which don't have the EVIOCGMTSLOTS ioctl yet.

0.2 (2013-02-20)
----------------
Compatibility break: This does not work any more with recorded ioctl files from
version 0.1.

- umockdev-run: Fix running of child program to keep stdin.
- preload: Fix resolution of "/dev" and "/sys"
- ioctl_tree: Fix endless loop when the first encountered ioctl was unknown
- preload: Support opening a /dev node multiple times for ioctl emulation
  (issue #3)
- Fix parallel build (issue #2)
- Support xz compressed ioctl files in umockdev_testbed_load_ioctl().
- Add example umockdev and ioctl files for a gphoto camera and an MTP capable
  mobile phone.
- Fix building with automake 1.11.3 and Vala 0.16.
- Generalize ioctl recording and emulation for ioctls with simple structs, i.
  e. no pointer fields. This makes it much easier to add more ioctls in the
  future. 
- Store return values of ioctls in records, as they are not always 0
  (like EVIOCGBIT)
- Add support for ioctl ranges (like EVIOCGABS) and ioctls with variable length
  (like EVIOCGBIT).
- Add all reading evdev ioctls, for recording and mocking input devices like
  touch pads, touch screens, or keyboards. (issue #1)

0.1 (2013-02-12)
