0.2.10 (UNRELEASED)
-------------------
- Make stat()ing of emulated /dev/ nodes appear as actual block/char device
  nodes with proper major/minor number, instead of regular files. (issue #16)
- Add umockdev_testbed_add_from_file() convenience wrapper around
  add_from_string(). (issue #15)

0.2.9 (2013-06-20)
------------------
- preload: Do not change errno when calculating wrapped paths.
- Add umockdev_testbed_disable() and umockdev_testbed_enable() methods for
  temporarily disabling the emulated /sys and /dev. This can be used for
  temporarily switching back to the real /sys and /dev without having to
  destroy or change $UMOCKDEV_DIR and the UMockdevTestbed instance (which is
  difficult when these get exported to subprocesses like local D-BUS
  instances).

0.2.8 (2013-06-17)
------------------
- Link the typelib to the SONAMEd library, not the version-less development
  symlink.

0.2.7 (2013-06-17)
------------------
- Slightly relax errno test in /umockdev-testbed-vala/usbfs_ioctl_static, the
  real call might fail not just with ENOTTY but also with EINVAL.
- Fix tests to work on big-endian machines (tested on powerpc32).

0.2.6 (2013-06-13)
------------------
- Do not use automake 1.13's parallel test runner. It not buy much for this
  project, and makes it a lot harder to analyse test failures from build logs.
- Add umockdev_testbed_clear() method to remove all added devices (both sysfs
  and /dev). This is useful for cleaning up between tests in situations where
  the UMockdevTestbed object itself needs to be kept.
- test-umockdev-run: Write X.org log into a file, point to it on X.org startup
  failure, and also point out that this needs X.org's dummy driver installed.
  (issue #12)
- Fix ioctl file reading on platforms which have unsigned "char" by default,
  such as ARM. (issue #11)
- Do not read sysfs attributes of any Tegra device (on ARM systems), as these
  often trigger kernel crashes (see https://launchpad.net/bugs/1190225).
  (issue #11)
- Allow uncommon characters in sysfs attribute names.
- devices/input/synaptics-touchpad.ioctl: Add ioctl for 32 bit systems.
  (issue #13)

0.2.5 (2013-06-10)
------------------
- Fix test-umockdev lsusb check to work in environments without any
  /dev/bus/usb.
- preload: Do not destroy errno on wrapping open() under umockdev-record.
- Add --version option to umockdev-run and umockdev-record.
- Fix building with Vala 0.20.

0.2.4 (2013-06-05)
------------------
- Fix "make check" for current automake 1.13.
- Add "make check-installed" target to run tests against the installed umockdev
  instead of against the build tree.

0.2.3 (2013-05-25)
------------------
- preload: Wrap fopen64() call; fixes operation on 32 bit architectures.
  (issue #10)

0.2.2 (2013-05-24)
------------------
- umockdev-run: Fix segfault if no program is specified. (issue #6)
- preload: Print proper error message instead of assertion when trying to load
  an empty or invalid ioctl record. (issue #8)
- umockdev-run: Fix --help output to not mention the child program twice.
- Fix DEVNAME property with older libudev versions.
- Handle "L:" (link priority) lines from udevadm for newer udev versions.
- Fix segfault with gcc 4.8 (due to changed behaviour of sizeof).
- Drop our posix_extra backport of execvp(), this was added to Vala 0.16.1.
  Bump vala dependency accordingly.

0.2.1 (2013-02-21)
------------------
- umockdev-wrapper: Use exec to avoid keeping the shell process around and make
  killing the subprogram from outside work properly.
- Fix building with automake 1.12, thanks Peter Hutterer.
- Support opening several netlink sockets (i. e. udev monitors) at the same
  time.
- Fix building with older kernels which don't have the EVIOCGMTSLOTS ioctl yet.

0.2 (2013-02-20)
----------------
Compatibility break: This does not work any more with recorded ioctl files from
version 0.1.

- umockdev-run: Fix running of child program to keep stdin.
- preload: Fix resolution of "/dev" and "/sys"
- ioctl_tree: Fix endless loop when the first encountered ioctl was unknown
- preload: Support opening a /dev node multiple times for ioctl emulation
  (issue #3)
- Fix parallel build (issue #2)
- Support xz compressed ioctl files in umockdev_testbed_load_ioctl().
- Add example umockdev and ioctl files for a gphoto camera and an MTP capable
  mobile phone.
- Fix building with automake 1.11.3 and Vala 0.16.
- Generalize ioctl recording and emulation for ioctls with simple structs, i.
  e. no pointer fields. This makes it much easier to add more ioctls in the
  future. 
- Store return values of ioctls in records, as they are not always 0
  (like EVIOCGBIT)
- Add support for ioctl ranges (like EVIOCGABS) and ioctls with variable length
  (like EVIOCGBIT).
- Add all reading evdev ioctls, for recording and mocking input devices like
  touch pads, touch screens, or keyboards. (issue #1)

0.1 (2013-02-12)
----------------
Initial release.
