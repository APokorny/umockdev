umockdev
========

umockdev mocks hardware devices for creating unit tests for libraries and
programs that handle Linux hardware devices.

The UMockdevTestbed class builds a temporary sandbox for mock devices.  Right
now this covers sysfs, uevents, and /dev devices, but other aspects (such as
ioctls) will be added in the future. You can add a number of devices including
arbitrary sysfs attributes and udev properties, and then run your software in
that test bed that is independent of the actual hardware it is running on.
With this you can simulate particular hardware in virtual environments up to
some degree, without needing any particular privileges or disturbing the whole
system.

The library supports gobject-introspection, so that you can also use it with
Python, JavaScript, and other languages which support GI.
